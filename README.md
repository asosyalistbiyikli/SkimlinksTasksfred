SQL Question
-

An organization maintains employment data in three tables: EMPLOYEE, COMPANY, and SALARY.
Write a query to print the names of every company where the average salary is greater than 
or equal to 40000.  Each distinct row of results in the output must contain the name of a company 
whose average employee salary is â‰¥ 40,000 in the COMPANY.NAME format.

ANSWER
--

SELECT DISTINCT COMPANY.NAME
FROM COMPANY
INNER JOIN SALARY ON COMPANY.ID = SALARY.COMPANY_ID
INNER JOIN EMPLOYEE ON EMPLOYEE.ID = SALARY.EMPLOYEE_ID
GROUP BY COMPANY.NAME HAVING AVG(SAL)>=40000

DISTINCT: to remove duplicate values
INNER JOIN: selects all rows from both participating tables as long as there is a match between the columns
